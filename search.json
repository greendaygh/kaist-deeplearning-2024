It is widely used in research and industry due to its dynamic computation graph and ease of use.\nPyTorch Ecosystem Overview:\ntorch: The core library for tensor operations and automatic differentiation. torch.nn: A sub-library used to build and train neural network models. torch.optim: Tools for optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam). torchvision: Provides datasets, pre-trained models, and image transformations.\n\n\n4 Linear regression\n\n4.0.1 Simple linear regression\n\\(y_i = b_0 + b_1 x_i + e_i\\)\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\nX = np.array(range(1, 10, 2))\nY = X*2 + np.random.normal(0, 1, len(X))\n\nX_b = np.c_[np.ones(len(X)), X]\ntheta_best = np.linalg.inv(X_b.T.dot(X_b)).dot(X_b.T).dot(Y)\nprint(theta_best)\n\n[0.4091132  2.00997796]\n\n\n\\(y = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + ... + w_n x_n + b\\)\nTensors\nTensors are the primary data structures in PyTorch, analogous to NumPy arrays but with added capabilities such as the ability to run on GPUs for faster computation.\n\nimport torch\n\ntensor = torch.tensor([[1,2], [3,4]], dtype=torch.float32)\nprint(tensor)\n\ntensor([[1., 2.],\n        [3., 4.]])\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Neural networks\nNeural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, used to recognize patterns and perform tasks like classification, regression, and more complex functions in various fields including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.\n\n5.0.1 Key Characteristics of Neural Networks:\n\nArchitecture:\n\nNeurons (Nodes): Basic units of a neural network that take inputs, perform a computation, and pass outputs to the next layer.\nLayers:\n\nInput Layer: The starting point where data is fed into the network.\nHidden Layers: Intermediate layers between the input and output that perform complex transformations on the data. More hidden layers and nodes lead to deeper and more powerful models.\nOutput Layer: The final layer that produces the result (e.g., classification label, numerical prediction).\n\n\nWeights and Biases:\n\nWeights: Parameters that determine the strength of the connection between neurons. They are adjusted during training to optimize the network’s performance.\nBiases: Additional parameters added to the input of a neuron to allow more flexibility in model learning.\n\nActivation Functions:\n\nActivation functions introduce non-linearity to the model, enabling it to learn complex patterns.\nCommon activation functions include:\n\nReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): ( f(x) = (0, x) )\nSigmoid: ( f(x) = )\nTanh: ( f(x) = )\n\n\nForward Pass:\n\nThe process of passing input data through the network, layer by layer, to produce an output.\nEach neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs, adds a bias, and passes the result through an activation function.\n\nLoss Function:\n\nA measure of how well the neural network’s predictions match the actual data. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification.\n\nBackpropagation and Training:\n\nBackpropagation: The process by which the network learns by adjusting weights and biases based on the loss. It uses gradients computed by the chain rule to update these parameters through gradient descent or other optimization algorithms.\nOptimization Algorithm: Techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam adjust the model parameters to minimize the loss.\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\n\nimg = mpimg.imread('images/nn.png')\nplt.imshow(img)\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2 How a Neural Network Works:\nImagine a simple neural network with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. Here’s how it functions: 1. Input data is passed to the input layer. 2. The input is transformed and propagated through the hidden layer(s), where each neuron applies weights, biases, and an activation function. 3. The result reaches the output layer, which produces the final prediction. 4. The loss function calculates the error between the predicted output and the true value. 5. Backpropagation is used to adjust the weights and biases to reduce the loss in future iterations.\n\n\n5.0.3 Simple Example:\nA neural network to classify handwritten digits (like in the MNIST dataset) might: - Input Layer: Accept an image of a digit (28x28 pixels). - Hidden Layers: Extract features and learn patterns in the image. - Output Layer: Produce probabilities for each digit (0-9), indicating the most likely classification.\n\n\n5.0.4 Applications of Neural Networks:\n\nImage recognition (e.g., identifying objects in pictures)\nSpeech recognition (e.g., voice-to-text)\nNatural language processing (e.g., language translation)\nMedical diagnosis (e.g., detecting diseases from scans)\n\nNeural networks have evolved into more complex structures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image tasks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data, enhancing their ability to solve specialized problems.",
